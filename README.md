# Classifiers
Some ML projects like Spam Classification, Malware Classification, Titanic Survival Prediction, Network Anomaly Detection.

- **[Spam Classification](https://github.com/At0mXploit/Classifiers/tree/main/Spam%20Classification):** A Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection that processes SMS messages through text preprocessing, feature extraction, and probabilistic classification to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.
- **[Network Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/At0mXploit/Classifiers/tree/main/NetworkAnomalyDetection):** A network anomaly detection system using Random Forests to classify network traffic as normal or identify specific attack types (DoS, Probe, Privilege Escalation, Access) based on the NSL-KDD dataset.
- **[Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/At0mXploit/Classifiers/tree/main/TitanicSurvivalPrediction)**: A machine learning classifier that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using feature engineering and multiple algorithms to analyze factors like age, gender, and socio-economic status.
